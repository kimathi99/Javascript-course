// Arrays are the next item on our JavaScript cheat sheet. Arrays are used in a variety of
// 
// programming languages. They are a method of categorising variables and attributes.
// Arrays can be defined as a collection of objects of the same type. In JavaScript, here's
// how one can make an array of cars:
var car ={
    2000:['corolla','Mercedes'],
    2001:['Range Rover','Bmw',]
}
let persons=["john",'mike','nafraz','michael','fred']
console.log(persons.length)
persons.push()
persons.pop()

// var cars = {"Mercedes", "Tesla","Volvo"};
// Now that we understand how to make arrays, we can perform a bunch of operations
// on them. Let us take a look at some JavaScript methods which can be used to
// perform various types of operations on arrays:
// pop(): This method is used for removing the last element of an array.
// push(): This method is used for adding a new element at the very end of an
// array.
// concat(): This method is used for joining various arrays into a single array.
// reverse(): This method is used for reversing the order of the elements in an
// array.
// shi(): This method is used for removing the first element of an array.
// slice(): This method is used for pulling a copy of a part of an array into a new
// array.
// splice(): This method is used for adding elements in a particular way and
// position.
// toString(): This method is used for converting the array elements into strings.
// unshi(): This method is used for adding new elements at the beginning of the
// array.
// valueOf(): This method is used for returning the primitive value of the given
// object.
// indexOf(): This method is used for returning the first index at which a given
// element is found in an array.
// lastIndexOf(): This method is used for returning the final index at which a given
// element appears in an array.
// join(): This method is used for combining elements of an array into one single
// string and then returning it.
// sort(): This method is used for sorting the array elements based on some
// condition.
